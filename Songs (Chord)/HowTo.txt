How to:

1) Find a midi file of the song you want to convert.
2) Import into MuseScore
3) Check there is a fixed tempo (e.g. one marked on the music) so that the output speed is 
   fixed and known.
4) Adjust the arrangement however you like.
5) Add all the bar numbers (Style/General/Numbers/Interval) for ease of use later
6) Mark up from guitar tab - make sure it is the right key.
7) Transpose it to D major (or possibly G or C) check it works, sounds okay and there 
   are no unworkable chords. It may be playable in the original key if the chords are playable,
   which means you could actually play it to the real song. Playing tunes in anything other than 
   D (maybe G) on a Merlin is going to be challenging without a 6.5 and/or 1.5 modification.
8) You now have a marked up document in the right key - the chords transpose with the music.
9) Export the tune as an MP3. this is your background song which will play along behind  you.
10) Create a text file with the markup in, of this format.

;
;	Firstly general information. 
;
tempo = 138										; tempo as set in muse score
beats = 4										; beats per bar
bars = 16										; bars in total (not intro)
pattern = V.V.V.V.								; strum pattern
music = pleasepleaseme.mp3 						; the name of mp3 file, same directory as .merlin file.
;
;	Then define the chords. These are a mix but are dulcimer chords. The dodgy one is F
;	5,0,5 which is played once, it is worth experimenting with this. Gm is also iffy. It is
; 	because of the "off key" C'mon C'mon progression in the song. Actually this song was better
; 	in E for strummng (chords are E,A,B7,C#m,F#m,G). But it's an example.
;
D=0,0,2											; this is the bass string first.
G=3,1,0
F=5,0,5
A7=4,4,3
Gm=3,3,3
Em=1,1,1
Bm=2,1,0
;
;	Finally the music. These are beats-bars and chords. 3 is shorthand for bar 3 beat 1
;	3.3 means bar 3 beat 3. This is why you put the bar numbers on on MuseScore :)

11) Run the python script on this program to generate a .merlin file.
