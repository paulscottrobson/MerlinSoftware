; 
;	Mark up for Please Please Me, transposed to D major.
;
;
;	Firstly general information. 
;
tempo = 138										; tempo as set in muse score
beats = 4										; beats per bar
bars = 16										; bars in total (not intro)
intro = 1										; blank bars as lead in required
pattern = V.V.V.V.								; strum pattern
music = pleasepleaseme.mp3 						; the name of mp3 file, same directory as .merlin file.
;
;	Then define the chords. These are a mix but are dulcimer chords. The dodgy one is F
;	5,0,5 which is played once, it is worth experimenting with this. Gm is also iffy. It is
; 	because of the "off key" C'mon C'mon progression in the song.
;
D=0,0,2											; this is the bass string first.
G=3,1,0
F=5,0,5
A7=4,4,3
Gm=3,3,3
Em=1,1,1
Bm=2,1,0
;
;	Finally the music. These are beats-bars and chords. 3 is shorthand for bar 3 beat 1
;	3.3 means bar 3 beat 3. This is why you put the bar numbers on on MuseScore :)
